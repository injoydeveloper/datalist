# Datalist Style Enhancer

This JavaScript module enhances the styling and functionality of HTML `<datalist>` elements and their associated `<input>` elements. It dynamically applies custom styles and improves the user experience by adding keyboard navigation and other interactive features.

## Features

- **Custom Styles**: Applies a set of predefined styles to `<fieldset>`, `<legend>`, `<label>`, `<input>`, `<datalist>`, and `<option>` elements.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Allows users to navigate through `<option>` elements using the arrow keys and select an option with the Enter key.
- **Dynamic Positioning**: Ensures the `<datalist>` is positioned correctly relative to its associated `<input>` element.
- **Mutation Observer**: Monitors the DOM for changes and re-applies styles and functionality to newly added `<datalist>` and `<input>` elements.

## Usage

Include the script in your HTML file:

```html
<script src="path/to/datalist-style-enhancer.js"></script>
```

Ensure your HTML contains `<input>` elements with a `list` attribute pointing to a corresponding `<datalist>` element:

```html
<fieldset>
  <legend>Example</legend>
  <label for="example-input">Choose an option:</label>
  <input id="example-input" list="example-datalist">
  <datalist id="example-datalist">
    <option value="Option 1"></option>
    <option value="Option 2"></option>
    <option value="Option 3"></option>
  </datalist>
</fieldset>
```

## How It Works

1. **Style Injection**: The script checks if a `<style>` element with the ID `datalist-style` exists. If not, it creates and appends one to the document's `<head>`, containing custom CSS rules.
2. **Event Listeners**: Adds event listeners to `<input>` elements to handle focus, input, and keyboard events.
3. **Dynamic Styling**: Adjusts the display and positioning of `<datalist>` elements based on the associated `<input>` element's state.
4. **Mutation Observer**: Uses a `MutationObserver` to detect changes in the DOM and re-apply styles and functionality as needed.

## Customization

You can modify the styles directly in the script by editing the CSS rules within the `style.textContent` string.
